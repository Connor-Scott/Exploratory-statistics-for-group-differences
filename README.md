# Exploratory Statistis for Group Differences 

This notebook runs three different exploratory statistics on constructed data for between group differences. 

#First Data Set 

The first data set represents from an experiment with five groups at different levels of a given condition. An ANOVA is used to explore meaningful differences between groups. 

#Second Data Set 

The second data set explores a hypothetical experiment between three groups with two Dependent Variables. MANOVA is used to analyze the data and the group differences are represented with a PCA Biplot and standard statistics calculated for each group. 

#Third Data Set 

The third dataset explores a hypothetical 3X3 experimental design, where there are nine total conditions and three total dependent variables. Again a MANOVA is used to calculate the results. The results are plotted with a 3D manipulatable plot to visualize the three different independent variables. 


All hypothetical situations are set up to result in manful differences being found for at least one condition. In each of these situations the null hypothesis would fail to be rejected, whatever that null hypothesis or alternate hypothesis may have been.
